# Group Project - C19 Hjälp mig

C19 Hjälp mig is an application to help us pass through this pandemic situation in a better way. 
During this time that we need social distancing and avoid go out, specially people more vulnerable - [group risk](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses).
With this in mind, we create this website where people who need help can connect to people who can help. 
A person can help a neighbor or someone else doing groceries, going to the pharmacy, collect a pack in the post/box, or even take a pet to go for a walk.
Our intention is to connect people, further our values in society, and help go out this situation better then we got in.

## Mission

Our website, *C-19 Hjälp mig*, exists to generate a greater sense of community, allowing people to be kind and support each other at a time when cooperation is so necessary, but also to allow those in need to remain in a shelter to be safe.
